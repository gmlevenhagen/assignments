            Summary 
        </h2>

        <p>
            I am currently a student at DePaul University working on a Bachelors in UX Design. I had a previous career in auto finance that spand over 14 years. I have been working towards a new career since 2020. I went to a coding bootcamp and a UX bootcamp then spent a year endlessly looking for a job before I realized I needed to further my skills and education in UX.
